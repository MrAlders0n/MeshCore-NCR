# Companion Nodes

Companion nodes run dedicated companion firmware and operate as user endpoints on the MeshCore/Meshtastic network.  
Most companion nodes pair with your smartphone over BLE to provide access to the mesh.

There are also standalone companion nodes with built-in screens and input devices. These operate without a smartphone but still function as endpoints.  

## BLE Companions

These devices require a smartphone and the MeshCore or Meshtastic app. They connect to your phone over BLE, and you use the app to interact with the mesh. In this setup, the companion acts only as the radio, linking your phone to the mesh network.

### Pre-Built

The easiest way to get started is to buy a companion node, flash it with MeshCore/Meshtastic, and join the mesh.

We still recommend choosing one of the recommended antennas, since most devices ship with poorly tuned stock antennas.

The MeshCore/Meshtastic app connects to the node over Bluetooth (BLE) and is used to send and receive messages on the mesh.

The following pre-built companion nodes are popular and widely available:

| Product            | Notes | Link |
|--------------------|-------|------|
| **ThinkNode M1** | Compact device powered by the nRF52840 with a 1.54" screen and GPS support. Designed as a ready-to-use companion node for reliable messaging and tracking. | [Elecrow](https://www.elecrow.com/thinknode-m1-meshtastic-lora-signal-transceiver-powered-by-nrf52840-with-154-screen-support-gps.html) |
| **LilyGO T-Echo** | Compact device with onboard display and GPS. A solid ready-to-use option with minimal setup required. **Note:** Buy the non-flashed version; it’s cheaper and easy to flash MeshCore/Meshtastic using the web flasher. | [LilyGO Store](https://lilygo.cc/products/t-echo-lilygo) |
| **SenseCAP T1000-E** | Slim card-style tracker device from SeeedStudio. Portable and IP65-rated. **Note:** Range is more limited due to internal antennas. | [SeeedStudio](https://www.seeedstudio.com/SenseCAP-Card-Tracker-T1000-E-for-Meshtastic-p-5913.html) |
| **RAK WisMesh Tag** | Rugged device with GPS, integrated antennas, 1000mAh battery, and IP66 enclosure. Pre-flashed firmware for instant use. **Note:** Range is more limited due to internal antennas. | [AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005009754254701.html) |

### Build Your Own

For hobbyists who like to source parts and assemble their own node, here is an Ottawa-friendly example build (antenna not included; see recommendations above).

We still recommend choosing one of the antennas listed above, since most devices ship with poorly tuned stock antennas.

This is a **companion node** role and requires a smartphone.  
The MeshCore/Meshtastic app connects to the node over Bluetooth (BLE) and is used to send and receive messages on the mesh.

### Example DIY Build

| Item         | Product Name                  | Cost (CAD) | Link |
|--------------|-------------------------------|------------|------|
| **LoRa Board** | Heltek T114 (Bundle with screen & case) | $48.18 | [AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005007916299029.html) |
| **Battery**   | Makerfocus 3.7V 3000mAh LiPo | $10.00     | [MakerFocus](https://www.makerfocus.com/products/makerfocus-3-7v-3000mah-lithium-rechargeable-battery-1s-3c-lipo-battery-pack-of-4?variant=44823607541998) |

*Approximate total cost (excluding antenna): **$58.18 CAD***

## Standalone Nodes

There are standalone devices such as the **T-Deck**, but we recommend starting with a companion node instead.  
Standalone units tend to be more expensive, the UI is not as smooth as the mobile app, and they still have quirks and firmware limitations that can make them challenging for beginners.

We still recommend choosing one of the recommended antennas, since most devices ship with poorly tuned stock antennas.

### Available Standalone Devices

| Product              | Notes | Link |
|----------------------|-------|------|
| **LilyGO T-LORA Pager** | A compact standalone LoRa messaging device styled like a classic pager. Useful for simple off-grid communication without needing a smartphone. | [LilyGO Store](https://lilygo.cc/en-ca/products/t-lora-pager) |
| **LilyGO T-Deck Plus** | Updated version of the T-Deck with improved specs and refinements. Built with Meshtastic/MeshCore/Meshtastic in mind.<br>**However:** the built-in trackball is a major downside and many users dislike it. | [LilyGO Store](https://lilygo.cc/products/t-deck-plus-meshtastic) |
