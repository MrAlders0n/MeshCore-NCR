# MeshCore Frequency Settings

MeshCore developers have published recommended frequency settings that balance performance and reduce congestion in the ISM band, which is often crowded with devices like smart meters and other IoT systems.  
Ottawa follows the new recommended defaults for the US/CAN region.

## Ottawa MeshCore Settings

- **Frequency:** 910.525 MHz  
- **Bandwidth:** 62.5 kHz  
- **Spreading Factor (SF):** 7  
- **Coding Rate (CR):** 5  

All nodes operating in Ottawa should use these settings to ensure compatibility with the repeater network and other companion nodes.
